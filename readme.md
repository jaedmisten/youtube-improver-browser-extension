This is a browser extension to improve YouTube.com.
Currently this extension:
1. Removes the animation home page link and replaces it with a basic link.
2. Sets the search input field to focus when page loads.

Future ideas for this extension are:
1. Use toggles to turn options off or on.
2. Redirect video shorts to a URL that uses full size videos.
3. Remove unneeded Explore link on left navigation menu.
4. Change vague time references (1 month ago, 1 year ago) to the actual date.
